/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Circuit Vision application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure, path-based access control with an emphasis on real-time data integrity for race simulations. It enforces strict ownership and role-based permissions. It assumes that clients are untrusted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /races/{raceId}: Stores race metadata.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: Stores driver information.
 * - /races/{raceId}/cars/{carId}: Stores car data within a race.
 * - /races/{raceId}/cars/{carId}/pit_stops/{pitStopId}: Stores pit stop events for each car.
 * - /races/{raceId}/race_positions/{racePositionId}: Stores race position data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is disallowed on most collections.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - Data validation is limited to ownership checks and relational integrity (e.g., ensuring document IDs match path parameters).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None necessary. All rules are based on path parameters.
